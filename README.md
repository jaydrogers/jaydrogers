# 👋 Hello! My name is Jay Rogers.

## About me
I’m a DevOps engineer who accidentally ended up in application & user-experience design. 🤖🎨

    In 2011, my friend <a href="https://github.com/danpastori">@danpastori</a> and I started a software development agency called 521 Dimensions. We kept the company to just us two. This forced us to learn how to develop software very efficiently.

    We took the experience that we gained in 521 Dimensions and created a blog called Server Side Up to help other developers create quality software using open-source tools.

## My Next Release
### 📕 [The Ultimate Guide To Building APIs & SPAs](https://serversideup.net/ultimate-guide-to-building-apis-and-spas-with-laravel-and-vuejs/)
[![Ultimate Guide to Building APIs & SPAs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaydrogers/jaydrogers/master/img/book.png)](https://serversideup.net/ultimate-guide-to-building-apis-and-spas-with-laravel-and-vuejs/)

We're releasing a book on how we structure our software for web & mobile apps. Since we only have a two person team, we need our development processs to be quick & easy!

We were able to figure out a way to:
* Build a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) JSON API
* Create a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) web front-end
* Generate iOS and Android Apps with [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/)
* **All from the same codebase 😱**
